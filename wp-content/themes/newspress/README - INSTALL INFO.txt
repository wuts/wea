   1. Download the theme and save it on your computer.

   2. Upload the theme to your blog from your WP-Admin Panel (Appearance menu).

   3. After you activate the theme, go to the ‘News Portal Options’ in the Appearance menu and configure the 3 categories that you want to appear in the homepage of your website.

   4. The thumbnails will be generated automatically for those posts that have pictures in them and appear in the homepage of the blog.

   5. Right sidebar: the right column of the theme is a regular sidebar that is configurable from the ‘Widgets’ page (in the ‘Appearance’ Section) of the WP Admin panel. all widgets that you put in the ‘Sidebar 1? container will appear in the theme’s right column.

   6. Main menu: The main menu is configurable from the ‘Widgets’ page (in the ‘Appearance’ Section) of the WP Admin panel. the widget that you put in the ‘Header left nav’ container will appear in the theme’s menu. IT IS RECOMMENDED TO PUT THE CATEGORIES WIDGET IN THIS CONTAINER since this will give the most natural behavior for a news portal. That said, alternatively you could put the ‘Pages’ widget in this container (for a ‘regular’ them behavior) or a ‘Links’ widget if you would like to configure the links on your own.

   7. You should also use the ‘News Portal Options’ in the Appearance menu in order to configure the following:

    * Upload your own logo to the theme.
    * The link to your contact us page. Alternatively, you could use the ‘mailto’ command for contact by email (e.g.: “mailto:Zoarra.Solutions@gmail.com”).
    * The link to your Facebook page.
    * The link to your Twitter page.
    * The link to your RSS feed.

NOTE: THE THEME WILL ONLY WORK CORRECTLY AFTER THE INITIAL SETUP OF THE MAIN CATEGORIES IN THE ‘NEWS PORTAL OPTIONS’ PAGE IN THE ‘APPEARANCE’ PAGE OF THE WP-ADMIN PANEL. ONCE YOU HAVE ADDED CATEGORIES TO YOUR BLOG JUST CHOOSE THEM FROM THE THREE DROP-DOWN MENUS IN THE ‘NEWS PORTAL OPTIONS’.
